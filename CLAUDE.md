# Rogue Talent — Claude Code Briefing

## What this project is
Rogue Talent (roguetalent.co) is a two-sided marketplace for professional models and clients. It disrupts the traditional agency model by letting models book directly with clients — no agency taking 30%. Built on the Sharetribe Web Template (React/Node.js), connected to a Sharetribe Extend marketplace backend.

## Architecture
- **Frontend/server:** This repo — Sharetribe Web Template (React + Express SSR)
- **Marketplace backend:** Sharetribe Extend — https://console.sharetribe.com/o/ndstealth1/m/ndstealth1-test/
- **Live dev URL:** https://rogue-talent-production.up.railway.app (Railway, auto-deploys from main)
- **Payments:** Stripe Connect (GBP)
- **Maps:** Google Maps API key AIzaSyAukffGuSop5-olv_RSrcyAgBgMePdELqc

## User types
- **Model** (userType: `model`) — provider role. Posts their profile as a listing. Sets rates, availability, portfolio.
- **Client** (userType: `client`) — customer role. Searches and books models.

## Key decisions already made
- Models CREATE A PROFILE (not "post a listing") — all listing/profile terminology has been updated in en.json
- The listing type is `model-profile` with calendar booking (daily unit)
- Commission: 10% provider + 5% customer
- All users require manual admin approval before full access
- Brand colour: #c41e3a (crimson red)

## Translation changes already made (en.json)
- "Post a new listing" → "Create your profile" (nav, topbar, manage page)
- Wizard tabs: Details→"Your details", Photos→"Your portfolio", Pricing→"Your rates", Location→"Your location", Availability→"Your availability"
- "Publish listing" → "Submit for review"
- "Manage your listings" → "Your profile"
- "Listing title" field → "Your display name", placeholder → "e.g. Fashion & Editorial Model"

## Phase 2 development — what's been done
1. ✅ Terminology/language changes (en.json commit b82fb2c3d1)
2. ✅ Post-signup redirect for models — models (userType = 'model') are redirected to `/l/new` (Create your profile) after signup instead of the default landing page (commit 0ad369239). Follow-ups: email-verification 'Later' link points models to profile creation (ccd65f868); own-profile banners use profile-first wording (272dac672).
3. ✅ Wizard step guidance copy — each Create-your-profile panel (details, portfolio, rates, location, availability) now shows a model-specific guidance paragraph beneath its heading (commit 147547baf). Adds a `.guidance` style per panel CSS module + five `*.guidance` keys in en.json.
4. ✅ Unified onboarding wizard — "About you" tab is now the FIRST step of the Create-your-profile wizard (before "Your details"). It renders the model's user-profile custom fields (`config.user.userFields`, from Console) and saves them to the user profile via `updateProfile`; fields remain editable in Account Settings too. New `EditListingProfilePanel/` (panel + form + CSS); wired through `EditListingWizardTab.js`, `EditListingWizard.js` (tab order, label/save keys, `hasRequiredProfileFields` gating, `currentUser` threaded into `tabCompleted`/`tabsActive`), and `EditListingPage.js` (`onUpdateProfile` dispatch + profile update state). Model fields themselves live in Sharetribe Console, not the repo — surfaced at runtime via `mergeUserConfig` in configHelpers.js.
   - **Location merged into "About you":** the standalone LOCATION tab is removed from the booking flow. The "About you" step has a city-level Google Places autocomplete (`FieldLocationAutocompleteInput`) which saves to the LISTING's `geolocation` + `publicData.location` (so location search keeps working). The old Console "City" user field was deleted, so location lives solely on the listing.
   - **"About you" is first and creates the draft:** it owns the **display name** (listing title) — moved out of "Your details" (whose title field is hidden when a title already exists, via `hasExistingTitle`). Because it's the first tab, in the new-listing flow "About you" CREATES the draft (`onCreateListingDraft`) using the display name + city + the single resolved listing type (`getListingTypeValues`, assumes one listing type: model-profile) and saves profile fields to the user — a dual save. `/l/new` now redirects to `tab: 'profile'` (routeConfiguration.js). PROFILE gating requires title + city + required profile fields.
   - Also fixed in this round: 72 mojibake strings in en.json (corrupted `…`/`•`/curly-quotes from an earlier hosted-microcopy import); and a tab-gating bug where the step after "About you" unlocked prematurely.
